# Archive Node

:::info
Read about [Full Node](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node) before this article.

## Overview

An Archive Node is a type of Full Node that stores extended historical data of a blockchain. If you are creating a blockchain explorer or a similar application that requires access to historical data, using an Archive Node as an indexer is recommended.

## OS Requirements

We highly recommend installing mytonctrl using the supported operating systems:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Debian 11

## Hardware Requirements

- 16-core CPU
- 128 GB ECC Memory
- 9 TB SSD _OR_ Provisioned 64+k IOPS storage
- 1 Gbit/s network connectivity
- 16 TB/month traffic on peak load
- A public IP address (fixed IP address)

:::info Data Compression
The uncompressed data requires 12 TB of storage. A ZFS volume with compression reduces this to 11 TB. The data volume is growing by approximately 0.1 to 1 TB per month, depending on the load, as of February 2024.

## Installation

### Install ZFS and Prepare Volume

Dumps come in the form of ZFS snapshots compressed using plzip. You need to install ZFS on your host and restore the dump. See [Oracle Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gavvx.html#scrolltoc) for more details.

Usually, it's a good idea to create a separate ZFS pool for your node on a _dedicated SSD drive_. This will allow you to easily manage storage space and back up your node.

1. Install [ZFS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/setup-zfs-storage-pool#1-overview):

```shell
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
```

2. [Create a pool](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/setup-zfs-storage-pool#3-creating-a-zfs-pool) on your dedicated 4 TB `<disk>` and name it `data`:

```shell
sudo zpool create data <disk>
```

3. Before restoring, we highly recommend enabling compression on the parent ZFS filesystem. This will save you a [lot of space](https://www.servethehome.com/the-case-for-using-zfs-compression/). To enable compression for the `data` volume, enter the following using the root account:

```shell
sudo zfs set compression=lz4 data
```

### Install MyTonCtrl

Please use the [Running Full Node](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node) guide to **install** and **run** mytonctrl.

### Run an Archive Node

#### Prepare the node

1. Before performing a restore, you must stop the validator using the root account:

```shell
sudo -s
systemctl stop validator.service
```

2. Make a backup of `ton-work` config files (we will need `/var/ton-work/db/config.json`, `/var/ton-work/keys`, and `/var/ton-work/db/keyring`):

```shell
mv /var/ton-work /var/ton-work.bak
```

#### Download the dump

Here is an example command to download & restore the **mainnet** dump from the ton.org server:

```shell
curl -L -s https://archival-dump.ton.org/dumps/mainnet_full_44888096.zfs.zstd | pv | zstd -d -T16 | zfs recv mypool/ton-db
```

To install the **testnet** dump, use:

```shell
wget -c https://dump.ton.org/dumps/latest_testnet_archival.zfs.lz | pv | plzip -d -n <cores> | zfs recv data/ton-work
```

The size of the dump is approximately **9 TB** for the mainnet, so it may take several days to download and restore. The dump size will increase as the network grows.

Prepare and run the command:

1. Install the tools if necessary (`pv`, `plzip`, `zstd`).
2. Tell `plzip` to use as many cores as your machine allows to speed up extraction (`-n`).

#### Mount the Dump

1. Mount ZFS:

```shell
zfs set mountpoint=/var/ton-work data/ton-work && zfs mount data/ton-work
```

2. Restore `db/config.json`, `keys`, and `db/keyring` from the backup to `/var/ton-work`:

```shell
cp /var/ton-work.bak/db/config.json /var/ton-work/db/config.json
cp -r /var/ton-work.bak/keys /var/ton-work/keys
cp -r /var/ton-work.bak/db/keyring /var/ton-work/db/keyring
```

3. Make sure that permissions for `/var/ton-work` and `/var/ton-work/keys` directories are set correctly:

- The owner of the `/var/ton-work/db` directory should be the `validator` user:

```shell
chown -R validator:validator /var/ton-work/db
```

- The owner of the `/var/ton-work/keys` directory should be the `ubuntu` user:

```shell
chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/ton-work/keys
```

#### Update Configuration

Update the node configuration for the archive node.

1. Open the node config file `/etc/systemd/system/validator.service`:

```shell
nano /etc/systemd/system/validator.service
```

2. Add storage settings for the node in the `ExecStart` line:

```shell
--state-ttl 3153600000 --archive-ttl 3153600000
```

:::info
Please be patient once you start the node and observe the logs.
Dumps come without DHT caches, so it will take some time for your node to find other nodes and sync with them.
Depending on the age of the snapshot and your internet connection speed,
it might take your node anywhere **from a few hours to several days** to catch up with the network.
**On a minimum setup, this process can take up to 5 days.**
This is normal.
:::

:::caution
If the node sync process has already taken 5 days, but the node is still out of sync, you should check the
[troubleshooting section](/v3/guidelines/nodes/nodes-troubleshooting#archive-node-is-out-of-sync-even-after-5-days-of-the-syncing-process).
:::

#### Start the node

1. Start the validator by running the command:

```shell
systemctl start validator.service
```

2. Open `mytonctrl` from the _local user_ and check the node status using the `status` command.

## Node maintenance

The node database requires cleansing from time to time (we advise doing this once a week). To do so, please perform the following steps as root:

1. Stop the validator process (Never skip this!):

```shell
sudo -s
systemctl stop validator.service
```

2. Remove old logs:

```shell
find /var/ton-work -name 'LOG.old*' -exec rm {} +
```

3. Remove temporary files:

```shell
rm -r /var/ton-work/db/files/packages/temp.archive.*
```

4. Start the validator process:

```shell
systemctl start validator.service
```

## Troubleshooting and backups

If for some reason something does not work or breaks, you can always [roll back](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gbciq.html#gbcxk) to the `@archstate` snapshot on your ZFS filesystem. This is the original state from the dump.

1. Stop the validator process (**Never skip this!**):

```shell
sudo -s
systemctl stop validator.service
```

2. Check the snapshot name:

```shell
zfs list -t snapshot
```

3. Roll back to the snapshot:

```shell
zfs rollback data/ton-work@dumpstate
```

If your node works well, you can remove this snapshot to save storage space. However, we recommend regularly snapshotting your filesystem for rollback purposes because the validator node has been known to corrupt data as well as `config.json` in some cases. [zfsnap](https://www.zfsnap.org/docs.html) is a nice tool to automate snapshot rotation.

## Tips & Tricks

:::info
Basic info about archival dumps is present at https://archival-dump.ton.org/
:::

### Remove dump snapshot

1. Find the right snapshot

```bash
zfs list -t snapshot
```

2. Delete it

```bash
zfs destroy <snapshot>
```

### Force archive node not to store blocks

To force the node not to store archive blocks, use the value `86400`. Check the [set_node_argument section](/v3/documentation/infra/nodes/mytonctrl/mytonctrl-overview#set_node_argument) for more details.

```bash
installer set_node_argument --archive-ttl 86400
```
