# Message Modes Cookbook

:::warning Caution

:::

Understanding the different modes and flags available for sending messages is important to ensure that your smart contracts behave correctly.
While [message modes](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes) section provided detailed descriptions of these modes and flags, in this section we will illustrate their practical application with specific examples.

:::info IMPORTANT
You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real-world confirmation.

#### Message value and account balance

:::warning
Please check how [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) works to understand transaction state better.
:::

There are 2 ways to pay for blockchain action:

- from [message value](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#commonmsginfo).
- from [contract balance](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/block.tlb#L263C1-L265C20)

Typically it's charged from contract `balance`, but in specific cases it will use part of the message `value`.

#### Fees

Actual transaction fees will vary depending on blockchain configuration, code of the smart contract and other factors. When message is received, part of it's `value` will be consumed for gas and storage fees.

According to [transaction flow](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases) there are 5 phases:

- Storage, consisting of [account storage](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L651-L675) and [in_msg import](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L783-L816)
- [Credit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L959-L981), where in_msg `value` is added to the `balance`
- Compute, where actual smart contract code is executed in TVM
- Action, where actions like `SENDRAWMSG` are performed
- Bounce, where everything about bouncing is handled

:::info IMPORTANT
The table is populated from [this example](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5e14a9c4a4e982fda42d6079c3f84fa48e76497a8f3fca872f9a3737f1f6262). You can check [**live calculator**](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula)

## 1. Send a regular message

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, [msg_fwd_fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#forward-fees) are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

![](/img/docs/message-modes-cookbook/send_regular_message.svg)

| Mode and Flags        | Code                       |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `mode` = 0, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 0)` |

## 2. Send a regular message, no bounce the message on error and ignore it

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.
In case of an error during transaction processing, the message will not bounce and will be ignored.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

:::info tip
Funds included with an ignored message will still be [credited to the receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a388731812c80ab9b0ea9531108425488af5def854e4bd6f0ed47362b56d557).

State after transaction with error: Account A has 1 - ([total_fee](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula) + `fwd_fee`) TON, Account B has 1 TON

## 5. Send a regular message with separate fees and bounce the message on error

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B**, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.1 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `balance`.
In case of an error [during action phase](https://retracer.ton.org/?tx=e9dccba82badc0d742f14eff41c203280f380e87180b5314fcfd742856e598f7&testnet=true), the message will bounce and `total_fee` + `fwd_fee` will be deducted from `value`.

## 6. Carry remaining value with new message

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON, Account C has 1 TON

**A** sent 0.1 TON to **B** after that **B** sent 0.5 TON to **C** with `mode` = 64, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received `value` will be 0.6 TON, total_fee + `fwd_fee` deducted from `value`.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.896 TON, Account B has 0.5 TON, Account C has 1.6 - (total_fee + `fwd_fee`) TON

:::warning
Please note that `SENDRAWMSG` doesn't update balance.

If you try to send multiple messages (i.e. mode 0 **and** mode 64) you'll get exit code 37.
