# Content Standardization

This document aims to standardize certain aspects of writing content to make the contribution process smoother.

## Content Preferences

### Use american english

For words that have multiple spellings, use American English over British English.

Examples:

- "decentralized" over "decentralised"
- "color" over "colour"
- "analyze" over "analyse"


### Use active voice

Sentences using active voice are more concise and efficient, making your writing more engaging and easier to comprehend.

**Active voice sentence:** an actor acts on a target

> _"The smart contract processed a message."_

**Passive voice sentence:** a target acts on an actor

> _"The message was processed by the smart contract."_

_This isn't an easy one, especially for non-native English speakers. If you aren't sure, don't worry. We'll help with any of these._

### Date format

When including dates in Markdown content across TON documentation, it is essential to maintain a consistent and clear presentation. To achieve this, we recommend the following guidelines:

#### Format:

Use the **"Mon D, YYYY"** format. This approach is standard for American readers, spells out the month (or uses a three-letter abbreviation), and minimizes confusion with day–month ordering.

#### Examples:

- Preferred: Nov 2, 2023 • Feb 11, 2023
- Avoid: 2-Nov-2023 • 11/2/2023 • 2/11/2023

By adhering to these guidelines, we create a unified approach to presenting dates, fostering clarity and comprehension throughout TON documentation.

### Linking to internal pages

When linking to another page on TON Documentation, use the relative path over the absolute path.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```


Do not hard-code the language path (i.e. `/mandarin/`) in any links. This maintains consistent functionality across different language versions of the site.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/mandarin/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

Add a trailing slash to all links. This keeps links consistent and avoids redirects, which hurts site performance.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview/)
```
#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

## Image Preferences

### Linking to images

When adding an image to a page, the image should be downloaded and placed in the TON Documentation `static/img` folder.

#### Correct linking:
```md
![How to mint your NFT](/img/docs/asset-processing/jetton_transfer.png)
```

#### Incorrect linking:
```md
![How to mint your NFT](https://docs.tact-lang.org/_astro/logomark-dark.BSmgZYWc_ZKRrUl.svg)
```

This helps us ensure the image will be available.


### Light and dark theme modes

TON Documentation supports theme-specific images. Follow these steps to add themed images to the page.

1. Themed mode is available only for `.mdx` files.

2. Import the `ThemedImage` module in the header.

```js
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
```

3. Set the links for both images according to the example:

```js
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2.svg?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2_dark.svg?raw=true',
  }}
/>
<br></br>
```

###  Annotation specification

Use a graphical representation that resembles a smart contract graph to depict message processing, including labels for transactions and messages.

If the order of transactions is unimportant, omit their labels. This approach simplifies the diagram and makes it easier to read and understand the details of messages and contracts.

### Annotation primitives

<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1.svg?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1_dark.svg?raw=true',
  }}
/>
<br></br>

* Avoid using a large variety of bright colors.
* Modify figures by applying techniques such as a dashed border.
* To emphasize specific details, display transactions using distinct line styles (e.g., solid and dashed).


### Message processing schemes

On the TON blockchain, it is essential to provide clear explanations of actor behavior and message processing for various smart contracts and fundamental scenarios.

The message processing schemes aim to offer additional context for readers seeking a clear understanding of actor behavior. These schemes should be unified throughout the entire TON Documentation to ensure maximum clarity.

#### Example

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2.png?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2_dark.png?raw=true',
  }}
/>
<br></br>



### Sequence diagram

In the case of complex and repetitive communication schemes between 2-3 actors, it is advisable to use a sequence diagram. For messages, use the notation of a common synchronous message arrow.

#### Example

<br></br>
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
      light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7.png?raw=true',
      dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7_dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
  />
</div>
<br></br>


### Scheme formats and colors

#### Fonts:

* Use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font family for all text within diagrams.
* Maintain a consistent text size.
* Avoid overusing **bold** and _italic_ formatting for optimal readability.

#### Themed colors for light mode:
* Pencil Hand Drawn (default Visio theme).

#### Themed colors for dark mode:
* Font `#e3e3e3`
* Background `#232328`
* Light Highlight(arrows and scheme borders) `#058dd2`
* Dark Highlight(arrows and scheme borders) `#0088cc`
* InnerBackGround(for nested blocks) `#333337`


#### Version control policy:

* Use PNG format for the diagrams in the documentation to ensure readability on various devices.
* Store the original files in the project's Git repository under the `/static/visio` directory to facilitate future modifications.
* Learn [Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software) references directly from [Visio sources](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/static/schemes-visio/).
