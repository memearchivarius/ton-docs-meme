# Content Standardization

This document aims to standardize certain aspects of writing content to make the contribution process smoother.

## Content Preferences

### Use american english

For words that have multiple spellings, use American English over British English.

Examples:

- "decentralized" over "decentralised"
- "color" over "colour"
- "analyze" over "analyse"


### Use active voice

Sentences using active voice are more concise and efficient, making your writing more engaging and easier to comprehend.

**Active voice sentence:** an actor acts on a target

> _"The smart contract processed a message."_

**Passive voice sentence:** a target acts on an actor

> _"The message was processed by the smart contract."_

_This isn't an easy one, especially for non-native English speakers. If you aren't sure, don't worry. We'll help with any of these._

### Date format

When including dates in Markdown content across TON documentation, it is essential to maintain a consistent and clear presentation. To achieve this, we recommend the following guidelines:

#### Format:

Use the **"Mon D, YYYY"** format. This approach is standard for American readers, spells out the month (or uses a three-letter abbreviation), and minimizes confusion with day–month ordering.

#### Examples:

- Preferred: Nov 2, 2023 • Feb 11, 2023
- Avoid: 2-Nov-2023 • 11/2/2023 • 2/11/2023

By adhering to these guidelines, we create a unified approach to presenting dates, fostering clarity and comprehension throughout TON documentation.

### Linking to internal pages

When linking to another page on TON Documentation, use the relative path over the absolute path.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```


Do not hard-code the language path (i.e. `/mandarin/`) in any links. This maintains consistent functionality across different language versions of the site.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/mandarin/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

Add a trailing slash to all links. This keeps links consistent and avoids redirects, which hurts site performance.

#### Correct link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview/)
```
#### Incorrect link:
```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

## Graphic Explanation Guidelines

### Linking to images

When adding an image to a page, the image should be downloaded and placed in the TON Documentation `static/img` folder.

You can reference the image like this:

`![alt text for image](/img/image.png)`

#### Correct linking:
```md
![How to mint your NFT](/img/docs/asset-processing/jetton_transfer.svg)
```

#### Incorrect linking:
```md
![How to mint your NFT](https://docs.tact-lang.org/_astro/logomark-dark.BSmgZYWc_ZKRrUl.svg)
```

This helps us ensure the image will be available.



### Message processing graph

To depict message processing, it's advisable to utilize a graphical representation resembling a smart contract graph, complete with labels for transactions and messages.

If the order of transactions doesn't matter, you can omit their labels. This simplifies the diagram, making it easier to read and understand the details related to messages and contracts.

#### Annotation Primitives

<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1.svg?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1_dark.svg?raw=true',
  }}
/>
<br></br>

* Avoid using big quantity different and bright colors.
* Use the modification of figures, such as using a dashed borderline.
* For better comprehension, different transactions could be displayed with distinct line styles: solid and dashed.


#### Message Processing Example

### Formats and Colors

#### Fonts

* **Inter** fonts family  for all text within diagrams.

#### Colors - Light Mode
* Pencil Hand Drawn(default theme)

#### Colors - Dark Mode
* Font `#e3e3e3`
* Background `#232328`
* Light Highlight(arrows and scheme borders) `#058dd2`
* Dark Highlight(arrows and scheme borders) `#0088cc`
* InnerBackGround(for nested blocks) `#333337`


#### Version Control Policy

* Set diagrams in the documentation by SVG format for schemes to ensure readability on various devices.
* Store original files in the project's Git repository under the "/static/visio" directory, making them easier to modify in the future.


### Sequence Diagram
In the case of complex and repetitive communication schemes between 2-3 actors, it is advisable to use a sequence diagram. For messages, use the notation of a common synchronous message arrow.

#### Example

<br></br>
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
      light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7.svg?raw=true',
      dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7_dark.svg?raw=true',
    }}
  />
</div>
<br></br>
