# Content Standardization

This document aims to standardize certain aspects of writing content to make the contribution process smoother.

## Content Preferences

### Use American English

For words that have multiple spellings, use American English over British English.

Examples:

- "decentralized" over "decentralised"
- "color" over "colour"
- "analyze" over "analyse"


### Use active voice {#use-active-voice}

Sentences using active voice are more concise and efficient, making your writing more engaging and easier to comprehend.

**Active voice sentence:** an actor acts on a target

> _"The smart contract processed a message."_

**Passive voice sentence:** a target acts on an actor

> _"The message was processed by the smart contract."_

_This isn't an easy one, especially for non-native English speakers. If you aren't sure, don't worry. We'll help with any of these._

### Date Format

When including dates in Markdown content across TON documentation, it is essential to maintain a consistent and clear presentation. To achieve this, we recommend the following guidelines:

#### Format:

Use the **"Mon D, YYYY"** format. This approach is standard for American readers, spells out the month (or uses a three-letter abbreviation), and minimizes confusion with day–month ordering.

#### Examples:

- Preferred: Nov 2, 2023 • Feb 11, 2023
- Avoid: 2-Nov-2023 • 11/2/2023 • 2/11/2023

By adhering to these guidelines, we create a unified approach to presenting dates, fostering clarity and comprehension throughout TON documentation.

### Linking to internal pages

When linking to another page on TON Documentation, use the relative path over the absolute path. Do not hard-code the language path (i.e. `/mandarin/`) in any links. This maintains consistent functionality across different language versions of the site.


```md
<!-- Good -->

Read more about [smart contracts](/mandarin/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)

<!-- Bad -->

Read more about [smart contracts](/mandarin/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
Read more about [smart contracts](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

Please also add a trailing slash to all links. This keeps links consistent and avoids redirects, which hurts site performance.

```md
<!-- Good -->

Read more about [smart contracts](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/)

<!-- Bad -->

Read more about [smart contracts](/docs/developers/smart-contracts)
```

### Linking to images {#images}

When adding an image to a page, the image should be downloaded and placed in the same folder as the markdown file. You can reference the image like this:

`![alt text for image](./image.png)`

```md
<!-- Good -->

![How to mint your NFT](./mintYourNFT.gif)

<!-- Bad -->

![How to mint your NFT](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0342fj_fsdfs.gif)
```

This helps us ensure the image will be available.

### Header casing {#header-casing}

This site uses **sentence casing** for header names as a convention. Only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. This applies to all markdown files on lines that begin with hashes (#).

```md
<!-- Good -->

## Minting your NFT

### Setting up your wallet

### Get enough toncoin

<!-- Bad -->

## Minting Your NFT

### Setting Up Your Wallet

### Getting Enough toncoin
```


## Terminology

### TON

TON should always be capitalized.

**Correct usage:**

### TON with a word

- It is essential to ensure the correct use of _THE_ in the TON documentation. _TON Blockchain_ and _TON Ecosystem_ are capitalized terms, and therefore, do not require _THE_ in their usage.
- We write _TON_ with regular nouns, and if it requires _THE_ according to English grammar, we use it. For instance: "_The_ TON Connect _protocol_ is a..."

**Correct usage:**

TON Blockchain
TON Ecosystem
The TON Connect protocol
