# How to contribute

## Contribute rules

### Who can submit content to docs.ton.org

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating our open source TON Documentation by turning their personal notes into detailed pages.

It is originally written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).
We aim to educate users about TON through clear, easily searchable content that appeals to both technical experts and casual readers.


### How to contribute

1. Develop your idea according [Style guide](/v3/contribute/style-guide/) and open a related issue.
2. Define your audience and determine the nature of your article (concepts, guidelines, or documentation).
3. Familiarize yourself with [Content standardization](/v3/contribute/content-standardization/) and [Typography](/v3/contribute/typography/).
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and concise updates according to the template.

#### Pool request template:

```md
