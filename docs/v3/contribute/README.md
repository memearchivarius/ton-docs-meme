# How to contribute

## Contribute rules

### Who can submit content to docs.ton.org

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating our open source TON Documentation by turning their personal notes into detailed pages.

It is originally written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).
We aim to educate users about TON through clear, easily searchable content that appeals to both technical experts and casual readers.
