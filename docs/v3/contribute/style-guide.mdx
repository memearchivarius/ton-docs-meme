# Documentation style guide

This guideline aims to help you define your audience, which in turn will influence the style and placement of your content.

## Audience


TON Documentation (**docs.ton.org**) is a resource developed for three key audiences:

[**Concepts**](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/introduction/) for **individuals:** 
Whether readers are new app users, investors, or blockchain enthusiasts, they'll find answers to their questions about TON’s credibility, wallet capability, community engagement, and technical roadmap. Concepts simplify complex concepts so that readers can dive in with confidence.

[**Guidelines**](/v3/guidelines/overview/) for **external developers:** 
If readers are developers with little or no background in crypto, our content offers a practical introduction to the TON tech stack. Readers can learn how to run nodes, set up sample projects quickly, and integrate their project with TON—all presented in straightforward, step-by-step guidelines.

[**Documentation**](/v3/documentation/ton-documentation) for **TON developers:** 
This documentation provides best practices and technical insights to develop industrial-grade smart contracts, improve blockchain software, and upgrade protocols. Documentation section focus on enhancing both the user and developer experiences through detailed, actionable documentation.


### Concepts for individuals
  App users, investors, enthusiasts, or anyone who is new in blockchain and TON

  **Example user journeys:**

  - "I want to explore TON's credibility and, after answering some basic questions, try using it."
  - "I know I need a TON wallet, and want to learn how it works."
  - "I want to get a sense of the size and activity of the TON community, to decide if it's active enough, so I can get help if needed."
  - "I’m excited about TON and want to get involved, but I don’t know what to do next."
  - "I want to learn about TON's technical roadmap."


### Guidelines for external developers

  **Example external developer journeys**:

  - "I'm a developer but I have no background in crypto and want to understand the TON tech stack"
  - "I want to learn how to run an TON nodes."
  - "I want to get a sample TON project up and running fast, to get a sense of how difficult or easy it is to build a real project on TON."
  - "I’ve started work on an integration my project to TON, and want to figure out how to do this in the best way."


### Documentation for TON developers

  **Example TON developer journeys**:

  - "I want to develop industrial smart-contracts for TON Ecosystem according best practice and specification."
  - "I want to participate in development of TON blockchain software."
  - "I want to upgrade TON protocols to enhance the user experience."
  - "I want to upgrade TON specification to enhance the developer experience."

## Best practices

### Style

- Focus on the advantages for the user instead of explaining technical details about the system
- Use active voice and clear, concise sentences that are easy to follow
- Break up longer chunks of text into smaller sections or paragraphs
- Consider using tables, bullet points or numbered lists instead of paragraphs
- Highlight (bold) key phrases to support scanning and skimming through the article
- Limit the length of the article up to 2000 words
- Reduce the number of hyperlinks to approximately 10 per 2000 words 

### Common content issues

**Common reading-related problems:**

- Specific technical terms
- Content inconsistency across pages
- Articles are hard to digest due to
- Content is too abstract and detached from reality
- Too much text per page and per paragraph
- Usage of complex sentences
- Too many links can overload readers, causing them to abandon the website

**Takeaways**:

- Operate with a mindset that people are curious about crypto, but not invested enough to spend hours exploring the topics
- Users want to understand how the topic relates to them and how they can take a part in it rather than going deep into the theory



### Content ideas

#### All section
- Provide visual aids to explain the topic better
- Provide style update and proofread

#### Concepts
- Use examples or real-life scenarios of the application of the technology to help illustrate complex concepts or ideas
- Explain how the idea can positively affect people now or in the future

#### Guidelines
- Add step-by-step how to take action
- Include relevant statistics or graphs to strengthen the arguments
- Add calls to action

#### Documentation
- Update or improve existing documentation.
- Add comprehensive new documentation about the TON Entity (Node, Oracle, TVM under the hood).


### Objectivity

TON Documentation (and content at large) aims to maintain a credibly neutral source of truth to inform readers about TON and its Ecosystem. Some examples of things that we don't want in the content on TON:

**Grand, unverifiable claims about TON or adjacent technologies**

> e.g. _"TON will take over the world because..."_

**Hostile or confrontational language aimed at any organization or person**

> e.g. _"Company X is bad because they are centralized!"_

**Politically charged rhetoric**

> e.g. _"This political party is better for decentralization because..."_

### Consistency

Many of the topics covered on TON are technically complex. To reduce confusion to the reader, terms should be used consistently. For example, don't cycle back-and-forth between proof-of-stake and PoS at random.
