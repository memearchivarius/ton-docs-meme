# Documentation Style Guide

Content on is crowdsourced and originally written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers) and support by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).

We aim to educate about TON through clear, easy-to-search content that appeals to both technical experts and casual readers.

You should read this style guide before you [contributing](/v3/contribute).

### Who can submit content to docs.ton.org

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating our open source TON Documentation by turning their personal notes into detailed pages.

## Audience

**Common reading-related problems:**

- Specific technical terms
- Content inconsistency across pages
- Articles are hard to digest due to
- Content is too abstract and detached from reality, therefore users are unable to relate to it
- Too much text per page and per paragraph
- Usage of complex sentences
- Too many links can overload readers, causing them to abandon the website

**Takeaways**:

- Operate with a mindset that people are curious about crypto, but not invested enough to spend hours exploring the topics
- Users want to understand how the topic relates to them and how they can take a part in it rather than going deep into the theory

Loosely we can categorize the site audiences as:

### Individuals
  App users, investors, enthusiasts, or anyone who is new in blockchain and TON

  **Example user journeys:**

  - "I want to explore TON's credibility and, after answering some basic questions, try using it."
  - "I know I need an TON wallet, and want to learn how it works."
  - "I want to get a sense of the size and activity of the Ethereum community, to decide if it's active enough, so I can get help if needed."
  - "I’m excited about Ethereum and want to get involved, but I don’t know what to do next."
  - "I want to learn about TON's technical roadmap."


### External Developers

  **Example external developer journeys**:

  - "I'm a developer but I have no background in crypto and want to understand the TON tech stack"
  - "I want to learn how to run an TON nodes."
  - "I want to get a sample TON project up and running fast, to get a sense of how difficult or easy it is to build a real project on TON."
  - "I’ve started work on an integration my project to TON, and want to figure out how to do this in the best way."


### TON Developers

  **Example external developer journeys**:

  - "I want to develop industrial smart-contracts for TON Ecosystem according best practice and specification."
  - "I want participate in development of TON blockchain software."
  - "I want to get a sample TON project up and running fast, to get a sense of how difficult or easy it is to build a real project on TON."

## Best practices

### Style

- Focus on the advantages for the user instead of explaining technical details about the system
- Use active voice and clear, concise sentences that are easy to follow
- Break up longer chunks of text into smaller sections or paragraphs
- Consider using tables, bullet points or numbered lists instead of paragraphs
- Highlight (bold) key phrases to support scanning and skimming through the article
- Limit the length of the article up to 1000 words (1500 max)
- Reduce the number of hyperlinks to approximately 5 per 1000 words (excluding further reading section at the bottom of the page or product listings)

### Content Ideas

#### All Section
- Provide visual aids to explain the topic better
- Provide style update and proofread

#### Concepts
- Use examples or real-life scenarios of the application of the technology to help illustrate complex concepts or ideas
- Explain how the idea can positively affect people now or in the future

#### Guidelines
- Add step-by-step how to take action
- Include relevant statistics or graphs to strengthen the arguments
- Add calls to action


### Objectivity

TON Documentation (and content at large) aims to maintain a credibly neutral source of truth to inform readers about TON and its Ecosystem. Some examples of things that we don't want in the content on TON:

**Grand, unverifiable claims about TON or adjacent technologies**

> e.g. _"TON will take over the world because..."_

**Hostile or confrontational language aimed at any organization or person**

> e.g. _"Company X is bad because they are centralized!"_

**Politically charged rhetoric**

> e.g. _"This political party is better for decentralization because..."_

### Acronyms

When introducing an unfamiliar acronym, spell out the full term, and put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the full term and acronym in bold.

**For example:**

"TON, is a blockchain ..."

### Consistency

Many of the topics covered on TON are technically complex. To reduce confusion to the reader, terms should be used consistently. For example, don't cycle back-and-forth between proof-of-work and PoW at random.
