# Typography

## Introduction
This standard ensures a consistent and professional style across TON documentation. 

By following these guidelines, you help maintain clarity, enhance readability, and support easy navigation in both the documentation site and any associated menus.

---

## File names
- **Naming convention:** Use **kebab-case** - all lowercase, words separated by hyphens.
- **Example:** `kebab-case-file-name.md`
- **Purpose:** Kebab-case is SEO-friendly, easy to read, and helps avoid naming conflicts or issues in case-sensitive file systems.

## Documents typography

### General text style
- Write concise, clear sentences.
- Use simple, direct language suitable for both new and experienced users.
- Avoid overly complex structures; aim for clarity and brevity.
- Avoid excessive use of bold or italic styles.
- All graphic elements containing text should use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font or a similarly compatible font.


### Acronyms

When introducing an unfamiliar acronym, spell out the full term, and put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the full term and acronym in bold.

**Example:**

**The Open Network (TON)** is a decentralized and open internet platform...

### Headers

#### Header hierarchy:
1. **H1 (`#`)** – Document title
2. **H2 (`##`)** – Major sections
3. **H3 (`###`)** – Subsections under H2
4. **H4 (`####`)** and below – Use sparingly for finer detail

#### Header capitalization style:
- **H1, H2, H3 and H4:** **Sentence case**
  - Example: `# This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `## This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`


- **Exception**: **Special terms**.
Despite the overall _sentence case_ rule,
  certain words or phrases—key concepts or defined terms within the documentation—must always be formatted
  using the title case.
  This means each significant word is capitalized. 
  - Example: `## Use American English`
  - Example: `### Date Format`
  - Example: `# Run the TON Center`

#### Header consistency:
- Avoid repeating the same words in consecutive headers.

#### Capitalized terms in headers

Sometimes you can face with specific capitalization that is defined as capitalized according to American English rules.

- Capitalization standard for specific terms:
- Example: `## Use American English`
- Example: `### Date Format`
  
Both Date and Format are special terms and should be capitalized, regardless of the overall Sentence Case rule.

### Navigation menu headings
Navigation menus should remain **minimalistic** in both the left sidebar and the top menu. All menu headings must use **Sentence case** for consistency and clarity.

#### Left sidebar menu:
- Avoid lengthy descriptions.
- Use short, clear labels of two or three words.

:::info
Left side menu is specified with [sidebars](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/sidebars) configuration files.
:::

#### Navigation bar menu:
- Set only highlevel hierarchy pages in this menu.
- Use broad, descriptive terms to categorize content, ensuring users can quickly identify the main section they need.

:::info
Navigation bar menu is specified with the [navbar.js](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/blob/main/navbar.js) configuration file.
:::

#### Consistency between menu and in-page headers
- Match the header text used in the table of contents or side menu with the header text in the article, ensuring readers always know they're on the correct page or section.

## Putting it all together
1. **Create your new documentation file** using the kebab-case naming convention
   * Example:`getting-started-guide.md`.
2. **Open the file** and set an H1 heading in sentence case
   * Example: `# Getting started guide`.
3. **Organize content** with H2 headings for main topics 
   * Example:`## Installation steps`, also in sentence case.
4. **Use H3 headings** for more detailed subtopics in sentence case 
   * Example: `### Installing on Linux`).
5. **Maintain consistency** in any side menus or tables of contents by matching the header text from within the document.
