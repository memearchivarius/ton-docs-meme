# Typography

##  Introduction
This standard ensures a consistent and professional style across all TON blockchain documentation. By following these guidelines, you help maintain clarity, enhance readability, and support easy navigation in both the documentation site and any associated menus.

## File Names
- **Naming Convention:** Use **kebab-case** (all lowercase, words separated by hyphens).
- **Example:** `kebab-case-file-name.md`
- **Purpose:** Kebab-case is SEO-friendly, easy to read, and helps avoid naming conflicts or issues in case-sensitive file systems.

## Typography

### General Text Style
- Write concise, clear sentences.
- Use simple, direct language suitable for both new and experienced users.
- Avoid overly complex structures; aim for clarity and brevity.
- Plain text should be free from excessive use of bold or italic styles.
- All graphic elements containing text should use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font or a similarly compatible font.


### Headers

#### Header Hierarchy:
1. **H1 (`#`)** – Document Title
2. **H2 (`##`)** – Major Sections
3. **H3 (`###`)** – Subsections under H2
4. **H4 (`####`)** and below – Use sparingly for finer detail

#### Header Capitalization Style:
- **H1 and H2:** **Title Case**
  - Example: `# This Sentence Is in Title Case`
  - Example: `## This Sentence Is in Title Case`
- **H3 (and lower levels):** **Sentence case**
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `#### This sentence is in sentence case`


### Navigation Menu Headings
Navigation menus should remain **minimalistic** in both the left sidebar (nested catalogs and articles) and the top menu (main categories with dropdowns). All menu headings must use **Title Case** for consistency and clarity.

#### Left Sidebar Menu:
- Keep titles concise, in Title Case, and aligned with the document’s H1 or H2 if referencing specific sections.
- Avoid lengthy descriptions; use short, clear labels of two or three words.

#### Top Menu:
- Title Case for each main category and its dropdown labels.
- Use broad, descriptive terms to categorize content, ensuring users can quickly identify the main section they need.


### Consistency Between Menu and In-Page Headers
- Match the header text used in the table of contents or side menu with the header text in the article, ensuring readers always know they are on the correct page or section.

### Additional Tips for Headers
- Keep headers short, descriptive, and relevant.
- Use keywords in headers to improve searchability.
- Avoid repeating the same words in consecutive headers.

## Putting It All Together
1. **Create your new documentation file** using the kebab-case naming convention (e.g., `getting-started-guide.md`).
2. **Open the file** and set an H1 heading in Title Case (e.g., `# Getting Started Guide`).
3. **Organize content** with H2 headings for main topics (e.g., `## Installation Steps`), also in Title Case.
4. **Use H3 headings** for more detailed subtopics in sentence case (e.g., `### Installing on Linux`).
5. **Maintain consistency** in any side menus or tables of contents by matching the header text from within the document.
